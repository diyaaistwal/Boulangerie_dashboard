An end-to-end business analytics project to help a local bakery turn their raw sales data into actionable insights.

Ever wondered what's happening behind the scenes at a bustling bakery? 🥖🥐

I recently completed an end-to-end business analytics project to help a local bakery turn their raw sales data into actionable insights. The goal was simple: transform numbers into a strategy for growth.

Step 1: Clean the Chaos 🧹
The dataset was messy; dates, times and prices all over the place. I prepped the data like a baker preps their kitchen: organized, standardized and ready for action.

Step 2: Dig into the Data 
PivotTables became my secret ingredient. 
I uncovered:
-Peak hours for sales (hello, morning rush!)
-Top-selling products driving the majority of revenue
-Hidden gems that needed a little promotion

Step 3: Visualize & Act 🚀
I built a sleek, one-page dashboard with KPIs and charts. 

Now the bakery owner can see:
-Real-time sales trends
-Average ticket size
-Product contribution insights
-Peak days and hours for staffing and inventory planning

Business analysis isn’t just reporting numbers; it’s about turning data into decisions that actually grow the business.

P.S. I’ve attached the full business insights report with all the details and findings.
